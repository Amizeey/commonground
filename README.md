#  CommonGround

**CommonGround** is a community space-sharing platform that helps schools, event centers, and local organizations manage how their buildings and facilities are used throughout the day. It brings structure, communication, and visibility to how shared community spaces operate.



##  What the Product Does

CommonGround allows organizations like schools or event centers to register their buildings on the platform and manage multiple uses of their spaces - from classrooms during school hours to football fields in the evening or community events on weekends.

It enables users to easily find, request, and book available spaces within their communities while helping organizations coordinate schedules and track maintenance.

Admins have full control of the system - managing users, organizations, bookings, and platform-wide data.



##  Why It Matters

In many communities, limited infrastructure is shared across different purposes - education, religion, sports, and events - often without any formal system managing the transitions.  
This leads to scheduling conflicts, poor maintenance, and underutilization.

CommonGround solves this by creating a digital system that helps communities organize, schedule, and sustain shared spaces efficiently.  
It celebrates the local innovation that already exists and turns it into a structured, tech-driven solution that scales.
